msgid "In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function is to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of the punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in the music, they serve to structure the musical phrases, and they also helps to establish tonality. For example listen to the following three chords:"
