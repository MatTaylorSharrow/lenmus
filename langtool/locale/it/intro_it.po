msgid "LenMus is structured as a collection of fully interactive textbooks (eMusicBooks), including theory and exercises. All exercises are fully integrated into the text. Music scores are not just images or pictures but fully interactive operational music scores that you can hear, in whole or just the measures you choose. This enables you to put concepts into practice with immediate feedback and makes the subject matter both more accessible and more rewarding, as you can hear, test and put in practise immediately any new concept introduced."
