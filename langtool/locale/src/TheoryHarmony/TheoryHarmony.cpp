Even now, there are subtle differences between the sound of a piece in one key or another, mostly because of differences in the timbre of various notes on the instruments or voices involved. But today the most common reason to choose a particular key is simply that the music is easiest to sing or play in that key.");
sTxt = _("Tonal center");

For example, music in the key of A major almost always ends on an A major chord, the chord built on the note A. It often also begins on that chord, returns to that chord often, and features a melody and a bass line that also return to the note A often enough that listeners will know where the tonal center of the music is, even if they don't realize that they know it. You will learn about this in more advanced lessons.");
sTxt = _("The simple, sing-along, nursery rhymes and folk songs we learn as children; the 'catchy' tunes used in advertising jingles; the cheerful, toe-tapping pop and rock we dance to; the uplifting sounds of a symphony: most music in a major key has a bright sound that people often describe as cheerful, inspiring, exciting, or just plain fun.");
sTxt = _("How are these moods produced? Music in a particular key tends to use only some of the many possible notes available; these notes are listed in the scale associated with that key. In major keys, the notes of the scale are often used to build 'bright'-sounding major chords. They also give a strong feeling of having a tonal center, a note or chord that feels like 'home', or 'the resting place', in that key. The 'bright'-sounding major chords and the strong feeling of tonality are what give major keys their happy, pleasant moods. This contrasts with the moods usually suggested by music that uses minor keys, scales, and chords, as you will see in next lesson. Although it also has a strong tonal center (the Western tradition of tonal harmony is based on major and minor keys and scales), music in a minor key is more likely to sound sad, ominous, or mysterious. In fact, most musicians, and even many non-musicians, can distinguish major and minor keys just by listening to the music.");

sTxt = _("What is an interval?");
sTxt = _("An interval is the distance between two notes, measured as a number. Intervals are named by the number of steps between the two notes. When we measure an interval, we always start counting at the lower note. We then count upwards to the higher note. Consider the following example:");
sTxt = _("\n");
sTxt = _("Here, we start counting on the lower note, which is C. We count upwards to the higher note, E. This gives us C, D and E. We counted three notes, so this interval is called a third.");

sTxt = _("To find the number of an interval, first find the note names of the two notes, (ignore any sharps and flats for now), and count the letter names, starting with the lower note on the stave, (it could be the first or second note along on the stave if it is a melodic interval).");

sTxt = _("You'll also be told if you have to write a harmonic, or melodic interval. This one is a melodic interval, so we'll write the second note after the given note.");
sTxt = _("Remember that we start counting on the lower note, which is F in our example. We've been told to write a 7th, so we count seven notes upwards: F, G, A, B flat, C, D, E. The seventh note is E, so that's the note we need to write.");

sTxt = _("In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function it is to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in music, they serve to structure the musical phrases and they also help to establish tonality. Listen for example to the following three chords:");
sTxt = _("\n");
sTxt = _("You will notice the feeling of conclusion, of reaching the end of a musical piece. The chord sequence does not create expectations of continuation. The composer could end the musical composition in the last chord and the listener will perceive that the end has been reached and remain 'satisfied' with finishing at that point. On the contrary, listen to the following chord sequence:");
sTxt = _("\n");
sTxt = _("Now the sensation is not conclusive. It is more like a short pause and it creates an expectation of continuation. If we end the music piece at the last chord, we will leave the listener with a longing for more.");
sTxt = _("Cadences are not difficult to recognize by ear but it is sometimes harder to recognize them in written music.");
sTxt = _("Cadence types");
sTxt = _("Depending on the sensation they create, cadences are classified in two fundamental types:");
sTxt = _("<b>Terminal cadences</b>. They create a sensation of stability, rest and ending of the musical phrase or sentence.");
sTxt = _("<b>Transient cadences</b>. They typically result in creating tension and a sensation of unstablility, as well as an expectation of continuation.");
sTxt = _("As an exercise you will hear a cadence and based on the sensation it provokes, try to identify if the cadence is terminal or transient.");
sTxt = _("Terminal cadences");
sTxt = _("Terminal cadences create a sensation of stability and conclusion of the musical phrase or sentence. This feeling is achieved by moving to the tonic grade (grade I) from any other chord grade. Depending on the starting chord grade, two types of cadences are considered: <a-1> authentic cadences</a-1> and <a-1> plagal cadences</a-1>.");

If the conditions are not satisfied, the conclusive sensation of the cadence is less strong and then the cadence is named 'imperfect authentic cadence' or just 'imperfect cadence'.");
sTxt = _("There are theoretical discussions about considering the imperfect cadence as a terminal cadence. Nevertheless, we have opted to include it in the terminal group due to sonority considerations.");
sTxt = _("The perfect cadence is usually found at the end of a piece of music and the end of significant sections.");
sTxt = _("Plagal cadences");
sTxt = _("A plagal cadence takes place when grade IV (subdominant) resolves in grade I (tonic), both in root position. The plagal cadence is less strong than the authentic cadence and it is also known as the 'Amen' cadence as it is used at the end of most church hymns.");
sTxt = _("In both cadence types, authentic and plagal, other chords playing the same harmonic functions can be used. For example, in the authentic cadence the V (dominant function) can be played by the VII. And in the plagal cadence the IV (subdominant function) can be played by the II.

sTxt = _("A half cadence takes place when the harmony moves to the V degree (dominant) from any other degree, except the tonic (I).

sTxt = _("Another very specific case is the Andalusian cadence. It only occurs in minor keys and is given by the progression I-VII-VI-V, where the VI degree can be replaced. This cadence has a particular colour due to the chromatic half step between the root of the VII and the third of the V.");
