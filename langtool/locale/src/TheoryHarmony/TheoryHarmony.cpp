Even now, there are subtle differences between the sound of a piece in one key or another, mostly because of differences in the timbre of various notes on the instruments or voices involved.

It often also begins on that chord, returns to that chord often, and features a melody and a bass line that also return to the note A often enough that listeners will know where the tonal center of the music is, even if they don't realize that they know it.

sTxt = gettext("How are these moods produced? Music in a particular key tends to use only some of the many possible notes available; these notes are listed in the scale associated with that key. In major keys, the notes of the scale are often used to build 'bright' -sounding major chords. They also give a strong feeling of having a tonal center, a note or chord that feels like 'home', or 'the resting place', in that key. The 'bright' -sounding major chords and the strong feeling of tonality are what give major keys their happy, pleasant moods. This contrasts with the moods usually suggested by music that uses minor keys, scales, and chords, as you will see in next lesson. Although it also has a strong tonal center (the Western tradition of tonal harmony is based on major and minor keys and scales), music in a minor key is more likely to sound sad, ominous, or mysterious.

In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function it is to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in music, they serve to structure the musical phrases and they also help to establish tonality. Listen for example to the following three chords:");
sTxt = gettext("You will notice the feeling of conclusion, of reaching the end of a musical piece. The chord sequence does not create expectations of continuation.

sTxt = gettext("Cadence types");

sTxt = gettext("<b>Terminal cadences</b>. They create a sensation of stability, rest and ending of the musical phrase or sentence.");

sTxt = gettext("Terminal cadences");
sTxt = gettext("Terminal cadences create a sensation of stability and conclusion of the musical phrase or sentence. This feeling is achieved by moving to the tonic grade (grade I) from any other chord grade.
