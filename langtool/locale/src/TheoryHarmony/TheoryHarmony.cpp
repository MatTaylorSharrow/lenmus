sTxt = _("Cadences");
sTxt = _("In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function it is to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in music, they serve to structure the musical phrases and they also help to establish tonality. Listen for example to the following three chords:");
sTxt = _("I");
sTxt = _("V");
sTxt = _("I");
sTxt = _("You will notice the feeling of conclusion, of reaching the end of a musical piece. The chord sequence does not create expectations of continuation. The composer could end the musical composition in the last chord and the listener will perceive that the end has been reached and remain 'satisfied' with finishing at that point. On the contrary, listen to the following chord sequence:");
sTxt = _("I");
sTxt = _("I");
sTxt = _("6");
sTxt = _("4");
sTxt = _("V");
sTxt = _("Now the sensation is not conclusive. It is more like a short pause and it creates an expectation of continuation. If we end the music piece at the last chord, we will leave the listener with a longing for more.");
sTxt = _("Cadences are not difficult to recognize by ear but it is sometimes harder to recognize them in written music.");
sTxt = _("Cadence types");
sTxt = _("Depending on the sensation they create, cadences are classified in two fundamental types:");
sTxt = _("Terminal cadences");
sTxt = _(". They create a sensation of stability, rest and ending of the musical phrase or sentence.");
sTxt = _("Transient cadences");
sTxt = _(". They typically result in creating tension and a sensation of unstablility, as well as an expectation of continuation.");
sTxt = _("As an exercise you will hear a cadence and based on the sensation it provokes, try to identify if the cadence is terminal or transient.");
sTxt = _("Terminal cadences");
sTxt = _("Terminal cadences create a sensation of stability and conclusion of the musical phrase or sentence. This feeling is achieved by moving to the tonic grade (grade I) from any other chord grade. Depending on the starting chord grade, two types of cadences are considered:");
sTxt = _(" authentic cadences");
sTxt = _(" and");
sTxt = _(" plagal cadences");
sTxt = _(".");
sTxt = _("Authentic cadences");
sTxt = _("An authentic cadence takes place when grade V, dominant, (or V7, a V chord with an added seventh) resolves in grade I (tonic). The authentic cadence is the strongest terminal cadence, with great conclusive power.");

sTxt = _("both chords are in root position;");
sTxt = _("the first chord is the V or the V7 ; and");
sTxt = _("the melody (soprano voice) ends on the tonic pitch.");
sTxt = _("then the cadence has its strongest conclusive power and it creates the most final sounding of all cadences. Due to this fact, if the previously listed conditions are satisfied, the cadence is named 'perfect authentic cadence' or just 'perfect cadence'. If the conditions are not satisfied, the conclusive sensation of the cadence is less strong and then the cadence is named 'imperfect authentic cadence' or just 'imperfect cadence'.");
sTxt = _("There are theoretical discussions about considering the imperfect cadence as a terminal cadence. Nevertheless, we have opted to include it in the terminal group due to sonority considerations.");
sTxt = _("The perfect cadence is usually found at the end of a piece of music and the end of significant sections.");
sTxt = _("Plagal cadences");
sTxt = _("A plagal cadence takes place when grade IV (subdominant) resolves in grade I (tonic), both in root position. The plagal cadence is less strong than the authentic cadence and it is also known as the &quot;Amen&quot; cadence as it is used at the end of most church hymns.");
sTxt = _("In both cadence types, authentic and plagal, other chords playing the same harmonic functions can be used. For example, in the authentic cadence the V (dominant function) can be played by the VII. And in the plagal cadence the IV (subdominant function) can be played by the II. These replacements add variety and harmonic colour to the cadence.");

sTxt = _("Another very specific case is the Andalusian cadence. It only occurs in minor keys and is given by the progression I-VII-VI-V, where the IV degree can be replaced. This cadence has a particular colour due to the chromatic half step between the root of the VII and the third of the V.");

And when used near the end of a piece, it helps to sustain the musical interest at the moment when the final authentic cadence is expected.");
