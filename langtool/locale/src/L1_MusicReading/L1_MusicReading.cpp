sTxt = _("The staff");
sTxt = _("In the Western musical notation system music is written on specially printed paper called 'manuscript paper' (see next picture):");
sTxt = _("The manuscript paper is organized as sets of horizontal lines, named 'staves', and each group of horizontal lines is called a 'staff' (in British English the word 'staff' is old-fashioned and rarely used; the word 'stave' is used instead). A staff is a set of five horizontal lines, numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the first line and the top line is the fifth line:");

sTxt = _("As an example, press the 'Play' link and lesson to the next score:");
sTxt = _("The clef");
sTxt = _("Sounds are represented by notes. There are seven notes named either using the first seven letters of the alphabet A, B, C, D, E, F (Anglo-Saxon system) or using the names Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La and Si (Ti) (Latin system). To determine which pitch (sound) is represented by each line and space in the staff a symbol, named 'the clef' is placed at the beginning of each staff. In this course we are going to start with the study of the G clef, also named 'treble clef', that is represented by the following symbol:");
sTxt = _(" The clef assigns a particular line to a specific pitch, and all other pitches are mapped in ascending and descending order to the lines and spaces above and below that reference line. In the G clef, the G note of the four octave is assigned to the second line:");

sTxt = _("We have learn that the vertical position of a note on the staff determines its pitch. The duration of the note (that, is the duration of its sound) is indicated by using different types of signs for the notes, so each note sign corresponds to a different duration.

sTxt = _("Stems are drawn on the right-hand side of the note-head when the stem goes up, and on the left-hand side of the note-head when the stem goes down. Flags are always drawn on the right-hand side of the stem:");
sTxt = _("Often, consecutive notes with flags are linked together in groups by replacing the flags by lines called 'beams'. The number of beams must be the same that the number of flags each individual note would have had when drawn isolated. In the following example the four individual notes at the first part can also be drawn grouped, as shown in the second part:");
sTxt = _("Measures and bar lines");
sTxt = _("Music is normally divided into equal parts named 'measures' (in British English the word 'bar' is used instead of 'measure').

sTxt = _("Time signatures");
sTxt = _("Most music has a rhythm that you can perceive as a repetitive pattern of pulses. It is easy to identify these pulses: is what we all do when while lessoning a song we clap our hands or tap our foot. These pulses are the 'beats' of the music and are the basis to organize the written music.");
sTxt = _("We said in previous lesson that written music on the staff is divided into parts named 'measures'. All the measures of a piece of music will have the same number of beats. Therefore, we must learn that written music is organized by dividing it into small groups of beats; and these groups are called 'measures'.");
sTxt = _("To know how many beats are in a measure, a 'time signature' is placed at the beginning of the staff, after the clef. The time signature is the two numbers placed above and below the third line:");
sTxt = _("A 2/4 time signature");
sTxt = _("The top number tells how many beats are there in a measure, and the bottom number shows the type of note that gets one beat; for now you must learn that the bottom number 4 means 'quarter note'. So, the time signature in previous example says that each measure will have two beats and that each beat will get a quarter note. The time signature is often called the 'meter' of a piece.");
sTxt = _("Not all beats in a measure are equal: there are strong beats (louder) and weak beats. The first beat of a measure is always strong and the other beats are weaker. The pattern of strong and weak beats is what makes rhythmic patterns different; it is important to learn to recognize the time signature when lessoning a piece of music. This may take some practice but it is a useful practice for anyone who is learning music.");
sTxt = _("The 2/4 time signature");
sTxt = _("The first time signature we are going to use is the 2/4 time signature:");
sTxt = _("As you know 2/4 means that each measure has two beats and that each beat gets a quarter note. Therefore, each measure will get two quarter notes. For example:");
sTxt = _("We also know that the first beat of each measure is the stronger one. Therefore, if you count beats along with the music, the 2/4 time signature will imply a rhythm such as 'ONE-and-Two-and-ONE-and-Two-and ...', stressing the ONE syllable, as if you were a soldier marching. For studying music reading it makes sense to mark the beats with the hand, the first beat of each measure with a knock down (on the table or at the air) and the second beat of each measure with a knock up (at the air or on the shoulder). You can also mark the beats with you foot, it you prefer, but it is very, very important to mark the beats. You should do of it a habit, at least until you get enough skills at reading music.");
sTxt = _("The tempo and the metronome");
sTxt = _("The tempo");
sTxt = _("The tempo of a piece of music is its speed, that is, how fast or slow the beats should go. But the time signature does not give you an idea about this, as it only says how many beats there are in a measure. In written music there are two ways to specify the tempo of a piece of music. Traditionally, composers relied on using verbal descriptions, writing indications such as 'Slow', 'Very fast', or 'Calmly'. These tempo words are normally written in Italian and are very common, even today. You should learn them:");
sTxt = _("Largo - very slow and broad");
sTxt = _("Larghetto - not quite as slow as largo");
sTxt = _("Lento - very slow");
sTxt = _("Adagio - slow");
sTxt = _("Andante - literally 'walking', a medium slow tempo");

sTxt = _("Allegretto - Not as fast as allegro");
sTxt = _("Allegro - fast");
sTxt = _("Vivo, or Vivace - lively and brisk");
sTxt = _("Presto - very fast");
sTxt = _("Prestissimo - very, very fast");
sTxt = _("The modern way to specify tempo is by giving the number of beats per minute. This is represented in the score by the letters 'm.m.' followed by the beats per minute rate. This indication is normally written at the beginning:");
sTxt = _("m.m. = 60");
sTxt = _("Instead of letters 'm.m.' also note symbols are used:");
sTxt = _("The metronome");
sTxt = _("The traditional metronomes are mechanic, based on a pendulum with a rod. The pendulum rod swings back and forth in tempo, producing a 'tick' sound on each swing. Modern metronomes are electronic. Next figure shows some examples of both types:");
sTxt = _("LenMus program metronome description");
sTxt = _("As an orientation, following table gives the assignment between traditional tempo terms and metronome settings:");
sTxt = _("Largo: 40-49");

sTxt = _("The quarter note and its rest");
sTxt = _("You know that in written music sound is indicated by using note symbols, and that there exits a note symbol for each duration. In written music silence is also indicated with symbols, called 'rests'. There also exists a rest for each note duration. The following score shows a quarter note and the quarter rest:");
sTxt = _("In this lesson we will start music reading by exercising to read scores composed just by quarter notes and rests. These rhythms are very simple as each note or rest gets a beat. Lesson, for example, the first four measures of the popular song Frere Jacques:");

sTxt = _("One half note equals two quarter notes and one half rest equals two quarter rests. So in time 2/4 a half note or rest gets two beats, and, therefore, takes a whole measure:");
sTxt = _("Ties");
sTxt = _("A tie is a small arch connecting two consecutive notes of the same pitch. For example:");
sTxt = _("The tie symbol indicates that the two tied notes must be joined, that is, the sound must not be interrupted when passing from one note to the other one. Therefore, when two quarter notes are tied they are equivalent to a half note. Lesson to the following score:");

sTxt = _("Leger lines can also be added on top, for high pitch notes:");
sTxt = _("As notes written on leger lines are more difficult to read, usually only two or three leger lines are used. If the pitch range does not fit on this extended staff, it is usually preferable to switch clef to avoid having to add more leger lines.");
