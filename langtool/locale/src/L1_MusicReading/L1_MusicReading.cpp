To determine which pitch (sound) is represented by each line and space in the staff a symbol, named 'the clef', is placed at the beginning of each staff.

These pulses are the 'beats' of the music and are the basis to organize written music.");
sTxt = _("We said in previous lesson that written music is divided on the staff into parts named 'measures'.

Therefore, we must learn that written music is organized by dividing it into small groups of beats, and these groups are called 'measures'.");

sTxt = _("Not all beats in a measure are equal: there are strong beats (louder), medium and weak beats. The first beat of a measure is normally the strongest one and the other beats are weaker.

Therefore, if you count beats along with the music, the 2/4 time signature will imply a rhythm such as 'ONE-and-Two-and-ONE-and-Two-and ...', stressing the ONE syllable, as if you were a soldier marching. For studying music reading it makes sense to mark the beats with the hand, the first beat of each measure with a knock down (on the table or in the air) and the second beat of each measure with a knock up (in the air or on the shoulder). You can also mark the beats with your foot, it you prefer, but it is very, very important to mark the beats.

But the time signature does not give you an idea about this, as it only says how many beats there are in a measure. In written music there are two ways to specify the tempo of a piece of music.

sTxt = _("The metronome");
