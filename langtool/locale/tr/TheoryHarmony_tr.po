msgid "In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function it is to create a sensation of either stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in music, they serve to structure the musical phrases and they also help to establish tonality. Listen for example to the following three chords:"

msgid "The deceptive cadence is considered a weak cadence because of the 'surprise' and 'hanging' feelings it invokes. Therefore, it is never used to end a piece of music.

And when used near the end of a piece, it helps to sustain the musical interest at the moment when the final authentic cadence is expected."
