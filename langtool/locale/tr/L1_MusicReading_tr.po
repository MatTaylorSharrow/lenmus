#: L1_MusicReading/L1_MusicReading.cpp:63
msgid "We also know that the first beat of each measure is the stronger one. Therefore, if you count beats along with the music, the 2/4 time signature will imply a rhythm such as 'ONE-and-Two-and-ONE-and-Two-and ...', stressing the ONE syllable, as if you were a soldier marching. For studying music reading it makes sense to mark the beats with the hand, the first beat of each measure with a knock down (on the table or at the air) and the second beat of each measure with a knock up (at the air or on the shoulder). You can also mark the beats with you foot, it you prefer, but it is very, very important to mark the beats. You should do of it a habit, at least until you get enough skills at reading music."
