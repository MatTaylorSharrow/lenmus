For studying music reading it makes sense to mark the beats with the hand, the first beat of each measure with a knock down (on the table or in the air) and the second beat of each measure with a knock up (in the air or on the shoulder). You can also mark the beats with your foot, it you prefer, but it is very, very important to mark the beats.
