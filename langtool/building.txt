                 langtool program installation instructions  
                ============================================

This document contains instructions for building the langtool
program from sources, on all platforms.


A. Requirements
=================
- CMake version 2.8 or higher
- wxWidgest 2.8 or greter
- The libxml2 library.


B. Building langtool
=======================

1) Building on Linux
---------------------

Open a terminal window, move to the folder in which you have unpackaged the langtool sources, and create a folder for building. For instance:

	checkout a working copy:
		mkdir lenmus
		cd lenmus
		svn co https://lenmus.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/lenmus/trunk .

	create folder to build:
    	cd ..
    	mkdir build-langtool
    	cd build-langtool

Now, using CMake, proceed to create the makefile:

        For generating for CodeBlocs and for make:
            cmake -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../lenmus/langtool
        For generation only for make:
            cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../lenmus/langtool 

Now, build the langtool program:

    make

Run it:
    cd ../lenmus/langtool/bin
	./langtool


langtool executable is installed in /lenmus/langtool/bin/. Therefore, once you have built it, you can remove the directory used to generate langtool

    cd ../../../..
    rm langtool-build -r


That builds and installs langtool on Linux. By default, langtool is installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin, with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX defaulting to usr/local.

You can change the install location by running cmake like this:

    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/new/install/prefix

Building from source in the repository is recommended, since code in the
repository should always be stable. If it's not, that's a bug to report.
