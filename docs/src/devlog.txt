 Development log

 Just my notes about work in progress or thinks to do in short time
================================================================================================

doxytags tags found in code:

 @todo        Warnings about things to do to finish something that have been coded provisionally.
 @limit       Program limitation (i.e. size of a table, ...)
 @attention   Explanations about side effects or important facts of a piece of code. These
              comments do not, necessarily, go to the doxygen documentation.    

other tags in code:
 BUG_BYPASS:  code to bypass a bug. It doesn't solve it but avoid a program crash.
 THINK: Considerations and thoughts to think about for improving the program.
 WXDEP: Code copied from wxWidgets or based on wxWidgets source code. The original
        code could change in future wxWidgets versions and we have to review to 
        adapt to those future changes.
 DOC: Important comment to copy/adapt for program documentation. 
 OBSOLETE: To mark obselete parts that remain there for reference (i.e. to illustrate how
        to do something)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LenMus project philosophy (to remind me to always stay on this):

    - p.156
    - I do it for fun, for learning and to help others, no for economical benefit -->
        - Free and Open Source for benefit of others.
        - No commitments that:
            - Takes me out of having a good knowledge of program code and
                of doing some programming.
        - Creates me time preasure or stress.
    - World wide usability -> Internationalization, comply with low end equipment (640x480)
  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - smile
  - Besides the C++ Programming Language, by Bjarne Stroustrup, the "official" guide to C++,
   I highly recommend Inside the C++ Object Model, by Stanley B. Lippman. (Lippman was one
    of the C++ honchos at Bell Labs.) This book will tell you what _not_ to do, as well
     as why everything in C++ is as it is. If you are confused by anything in C++,
      Lippman's book is the cure.
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes:
  - For hard coded books try memory file system: write book to file memory and instruct
	TextBookManager to load from there.
    
  Release 3.2, planned: 30/aug/2006 (to be released by 15/sep)
  ----------------------------------

    Features and changes:
    + Ear training: identify chord type
    + Theory: identify chord
	- Modify UrlAuxCtrol to optionally include an icon at the left.
    - To facilitate internationalization, eBooks Introduction and Single Exercises 
		should be coded inside the program instead of being external html files. 
		All other books will be written in Spanish and not translated by me.
    + Allow for simultaneous access to books in different languages --> It is just a
		question of moving books to the same folder; prefix book names with the 
		language tag

    Tasks:
	* Coding Ear & Theo Identify Chord exercises (IdfyChordCtrol):
	- Root note: now is the root of the key. Allow others?
	- Option: Draw chord cipher

	*  eBooks new architecture: design evolution
	- Hardcode LenMus Introduction page in program
	- Print problem: analyze code for ImageCell
	  
	- Icons for disabled tools
    - update help documentation 
    
    Minor issues:
    - spacing in tuples when a whole /half note in other staff
    - tuplet bracket line discontinuities
    - abbreviated notation for notes/rests in chords
    - stem up/down abbreviated notation
    - LDP 1.5: allow (na ..) for chords.
    
    Bugs:
    - Chord: loop when double sharp accidental (##)

    Bugs in Unicode version:
        - Release Unicode:
            - MidiWizard fails
            
    Spanish translation errors:
    - none
    


  Web site
  -------------------------
    - Remove changelog page
    - Add Acknowledgments page


  Tasks for future releases:
  ----------------------------
    - TheoIntervals: need to add answer button for 2dim (i.e.: b3 / -c4)
    - Slurs
    - Clefs: french (Sol1), baritoneC (Do5) and subbass (Fa5)
    - Clefs: octave altered.
    - Include XML import:
        - Treatment of ActualNotes and NormalNotes in XLMParser for tuplets
    - Different paths for Open and Import
    - (? ->no. i18n problem)Font for texts including some music symbols (accidentals)
    - Include theory reference book taken from Wikipedia?
    - view toolbar menu: several toolbars
    - re-locate toolbars if not enough space
    - Channge MDI child windows by notebook
    - Spanish .po translated file for wxMidi
    - ( LDP: allow for num_staves in voice tag only for non-overlayered voices ) ?
    - LDP: How to deal for example with four voices piano reductions:
        - flag overlayered in Instruments.
    - eBookManager: when user changes font size, modify scores scale accordingly.
    - Play toolbox: from/to measure number; instruments list; tempo; volume for each
        instrument; start/pause/stop buttons. Use this toolbox to experiment to
        design a common architecture for all future toolboxes

    
    Bugs to wait to next release:
    -----------------------------
    - If score horizontally scrolled and zooming factor is changed, new display is
        incorrectly shifted.
    - in some cases (6/8?) metronome is not syncronized when playing a score (i.e. E29)
    - memory leaks (chords?)
    - toolbars: problem with wxAUI no resize when change from label to no lables
    - in a chord, if a note has an accidental and the chord has the same note but
      in a different octave, the accidental is not drawn in this note unless explicitly
      encoded.


    Known problems:
    ---------------
    - wxDC::GetTextExtend() method returns not accurate measurements. This causes
        problems to right justify texts.
   
   
    Ideas for new/improved features
    ----------------------------------
    - Post-it notes, so user can add commens to eBook pages
    - Program always opens in last page/line of last seen eBook
    - bookmarked page icons for bookmarked pages
    
    
    

    - move logs to temp directory
    
    - width of chord = max width of its notes
    - render accidentals in notes order   
    - need to devise a renderization method based on plugins so that different
        algorithms, user selectable, can be used to compute layout
    
Organizational issues:
    - Integrate wxMidi so that LenMus package at SVN be self-contained.
    - Modify panel pendrive so that erased files do not re-appear
    
    - Strategy: work in secuence in all areas and plan things so that each cicle produces
        some visible result: launch a new release every month. a new document, etc.
        
Area 0: Bugs to solve
    - ¿lmInterval: fix names Unison augmented, Unison perfect, etc...?
    - If Midi Wizard is cancelled some non-relevant error messages are displayed when
        there is no soundcard on the computer (tested with VMWare)
    - MusicXML import: note pitch.
    - crash if click with right button on list of eBooks

        
Area 1: New features to add in short term to working release
    - Proxy issue for Updater
    - Add buttons for answers in scales build exercise.
    - TheoIntervals: double accidentals not generated. Analyze issue of 'four times augmnted'
    - TheoIntervals settings re-design: choose interval types (major, minor, augmented, double augmented...)
    - TheoIntervals: if no accidentals allowed, remove buttons for augmented, diminished, and double.
    
Area 2: Notation editor
    - divide notation features in phases and proceed by phases
    - slurs
    - draw page margins:
        - margins must be line objects in PageBox. They must be
            'non-visible' and there must be a method to render them when required.
            As any ScoreObj it must be draggable.
        - View menu: page margins
    
 
Area 3: Analysis and algorithms
    - sequences (Lylipond, Guido) vs. back/forward (MusicXML)
    - Role of GraphicManager vs. lmPaper. Gradually move lmPaper methods to lmBoxPage. 
    
Area 4: Documentation
    - Re-structure LDP manual: more didactical
    - Set up DocBook edition environment
    - Move all docs (algorithms, architecture, etc. to DocBook)

Area 5: Prepare a new book
    - theory; level 1
    
Area 6: Design new exercises
    - chords
            
Other:
    - Lyrics: compute maximum y and position lyric at a greater y
    - Debug links for TheoMusicReading exercises or use main menu options

    2 - Add check box to select not to show the solution when answered right and continue
        proposing a new problem

- Theo Key signatures:
    2 - Add checkbox buttons to choose direct and inverse problems


 - Beamed groups in LDP: automatic identification of typical groups
 - Slurs
 - Bug: hook beam after rest in group. Drawn wrong
 - For each exercise prepare an html page to explain it in the website. It could be
    also part of the help book
            


******************************************************************************************
Known bugs:
******************************************************************************************

        - Beams that continue in next system



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Settings in html embedded objects:
    - All objects must have a settings param specifying either the settings key to use
        to save user settings or that user settings are not allowed.
    - If user settings are allowed, parameters specified in the html object must be
        used only as default settings for prefs->Read methods.  

- In some exercises it would be nice to add an additional link "Explain solution" to 
    provide guidance to the student about the steps followed to find the solution. 
    This link will be enabled only after displaying a solution and will be disabled 
    when 'new problem' clicked.


- Composer5:
    Barline alignment constrains
    
  - Ties: 
    - too much space if stems up
    - continuation in next system
    
  - lmIntervals' constructor to build interval from constrains: replace dbg messages to
    use lmLogger methods
  
  - lmLogger: program DefineTraceMask() and GetDefinedTraceMask() methods.
  - Create dialog for Debug/Set trace level  and use previous methods.
  
  - Re-program lmTheoScalesCtrol and lmTheoIntervalsCtrol so that scale/inerval generator
    is isolated and can be systematically tested.

  - Play /Stop play labels toggle in lmTheoIntervalsCtrol class and lmScoreCtrol. 
  
  - Control single instance running and IPC server. See wxGuide and demo sample.
  
  - Add most recent files history to File menu. See wxFileHistory
  
  - Clarify issue of instrument in metronome settings (channel 10 & 16)
  
  - Review colors for scores. Use global variables instead of constants (wxBLACK, wxBLUE, ...)
    so that 1) avoid inconsistencies, and 2) allow user preferences.
  
  - selection rectangles sizes and positions: base them on a data file with information
    about the font metrics. Font module wedelmusic/openwedelmusic-1.0/source/fon/lioofont.cpp
    deal with .FON files (bitmap) and renders the font by setting bits on/off. Aparently
    no font resizing is possible. See also MuseScore/fonts/mscore20.sfd; in this file all
    information from mscore20.ttf is extracted and there is a reference to a utility for doing
    this
    
  - adjust selection rectangle of: KeySignatures, Accidentals in notes

  - Tuples: Positioning of bracket:
        - when notes not beamed
        - AutoPosition()
        - Selection rectangle for bracket
        - Number position: Take bracket line slope into consideration
  
  - lmNote: Dump of notations (fermata)
  
  - Change lmVStaff iteration from lmInstrument for something similar to iteration of 
    instruments from a score
    
  - Fromatter3::RenderJustified(). Things to review next:
    - lmVStaff::GetVStaffHeight
    
  - Metronome: implement LED. LED events created in two places: metronome, lmSoundManager.
    

TODO:
-------------------
   - Why Notes can not be moved?
