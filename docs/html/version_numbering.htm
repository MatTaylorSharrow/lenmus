<h1>LenMus version numbering scheme</h1>

<p>The LenMus version numbering scheme is simple: just two numbers (i.e. &quot;3.0&quot;). The
first one is the major number and the second one is the revision number.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Major number</strong></dt>
	<dd>It is incremented when a program change affects to a significative
	part of the code. It takes place normally only due to internal architectural re-design.
	<br /><br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Revision number</strong></dt>
	<dd>It is incremented when a new package is released.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition, if the release is not an stable version, with all planned functionality
and tested enough, it will be followed by a
<em>pre-release identification code</em> (i.e. &quot;a3&quot;) formed as follows:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Pre-release letter</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>a</strong></dt>
				<dd>Alpha version. This is a snapshot of current development. The version is
				operative but not all planned functionality is yet included. Also it contains bugs
				and unfinished code.</dd>
			<dt><strong>b</strong></dt>
				<dd>Beta version. It is an operative finished version, that is, it includes
				all planned
				functionality. But it is in testing phase and so it might contain bugs.</dd></dt>
		</dl><br /></dd>
<dt><strong>Pre-release number</strong></dt>
	<dd>Just a sequential number to identify the pre-release</dd>
</dl>

<p>Alpha pre-releases will normally take place only when the version major number changes.
Beta pre-releases are launched only when the new code is complex enough as to requiere
an extensive testing phase. So, for example, if the move from version 5.3 to version 5.4 does not
require a long testing phase, there will be no 5.4.b0 pre-release.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.0.a0 - The first alpha pre-release of version 3.0. Alpha implies that the program is not yet
	finished.</li>
<li>3.0.b2 - The third beta pre-release of version 3.0. Beta implies a finished version in testing
	phase. The pre-release number (2) implies that two previous beta versions were released.</li>
<li>3.0 - An official, stable and fully tested release.</li>
</ul>
