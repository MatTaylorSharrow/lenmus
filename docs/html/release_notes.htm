      <b>Clefs reading exercise does not display any score.</b><br />
      The bug was caused by the fix to memory leaks problem (3/may); the fix code was,
      inadvertely, placed in the wrong place. Now fixed.

    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Button colours in keyboard for answers in build intervals exercises not reset.</b><br />
      As 'build interval' exercise was added later, existing code to reset keyboard did 
      not take into account the later added keyboard. Now fixed.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In occasions, bad answers given for the exercises.</b><br />
      The problem was caused by rendering optimization code: if by chance the new score
      pointer has the same address than the previous one, it was not re-drawn and the
      previous score non-valid bitmaps got displayed. I tried to fix this bug (2-may-06)
      but the fix did not take into account all cases. Now I hope this problem is 
      definitely fixed.

<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In first run installed languages are not recognized.</b><br />
      It was caused by not properly setting the locale folder, as paths were instantiated
      after the language was chosen.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Keyboard for answers in build intervals exercises disabled after first answer given.</b><br />
      It was due to forgeting to re-enable the keyboard after generating a new exercise.

      <b>Invalid scores were sometimes generated in Music Reading Level 2 eBook, lessons 13 and 16.</b><br />
      The problem was caused by patterns with barlines marks in erroneous places. Patterns
      in eBook now fixed.
