<h1>LenMus Phonascus 3.5 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in 3.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A new eMusicBook included: Music Reading level 1</li>
  <li>Replaced MDI user interface by a notebook tabbed interface.</li>
  <li>The lenmus program now includes the Dutch language translation.</li>
  <li>Added support to include images on eMusicBooks texts.</li>
  <li>Score parameters in eBooks: added tag <metronome> to specify a fixed metronome
        rate to play the score, instead of using user specified value in metronome
        control.</li>
  <li>Improvements in automatic music composer:
        <ul>
          <li>Modified so that in final measure it never adds a note longer
            that a quarter note if the composed piece only uses quarter notes. This was
            needed for Music Reading Level 1 eBook, for the initial lessons.</li>
        </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in the Score internal model to support more features:
    <ul>
      <li>Support to include graphical objects (arrows, lines, circles,
        etc.) on a score. For now only lines are implemented.</li>
      <li>Implemented metronome marks notations.</li>
      <li>Added support to set up the size of a measure by specifying barline
        position.</li>
      <li>Added support for fermatas on notes and rests.</li>
      <li>Added support to have global, inheritable options in all score elements.
        Implemented support for the following options:
        <ul>
          <li>Option 'Staff.DrawLeftBarline' to control left barline drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.Hide' to control staff lines drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.StopAtFinalBarline' to allow for staff lines
            going to the right paper margin instead of finishing at the final
            barline.</li>
          <li>Option 'Staff.UpperLegerLines.Displacement' to shift the first upper leger
            line so that it is closer/further than normal spacing.
            The other leger lines spacing is not changed.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in LDP language to support the new features. New tags added:
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented simple notation 'fermata', and compound notation
        '(fermata [above | below])' on notes and rests.</li>
      <li>tag 'metronome' to define metronome notations.</li>
      <li>tag 'graphic line' to add lines on a score.</li>
      <li>tag 'spacer' for better controlling staff space.</li>
      <li>tag 'opt' to add global, inheritable options to all other tags.</li>
      <li>Added support for strings enclosed in double simple quotes as
        an alternative to double quotes.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
