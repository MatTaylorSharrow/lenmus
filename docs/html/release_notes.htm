      <b>Button colours in keyboard for answers in build intervals exercises not reset.</b><br />
      As build interval exercise was added later, code to reset keyboard did not take into
      account the added keyboard. Now fixed.

<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In occasions, bad answers given for the exercises.</b><br />
      The problem was
      caused by lmPaper optimization code: if the new score pointer has the same address
      than the previous one, lmPaper did not re-draw the score and the old non-valid
      bitmaps got displayed. I tried to fix this bug (2-may-06) but fix did not take
      into account all cases. Now I hope this problem is definitely fixed.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In first run installed languages are not recognized.</b><br />
      It was caused by not properly setting the locale folder as paths were instantiated
      before the language was chosen.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Keyboard for answers in build intervals exercises disabled after first answer given.</b><br />
      It was due to forgeting to re-enable the keyboard after generating a new exercise.
