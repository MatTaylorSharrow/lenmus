<h1>LenMus Phonascus 3.4 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in 3.4</h2>

<p>Release 3.4 includes, mainly, technical changes an some bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new eMusicBooks source format, based on XML and DocBook, has been developed
    with three objectives in mind:
    <ul>
      <li>To simplify writing eMusicBooks.</li>
      <li>To simplify the translation of eMusicBooks.</li>
      <li>To enable new features.</li>
    </ul></li>

  <li>The controller to display eMusicBooks has been rewritten to adapt to the new
    eMusicBooks format. Now the index panel can also display images.</li>
  <li>A program, named LangTool, has been developed to compile eMusicBooks and to
    automate the translation process.</li>
  <li>Supporting wxWidgets libraries upgraded to version 2.8.0</li>
  <li>Several <a href="#bugs">bug fixes</a> and other
    technical improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <b>[1604535 ] Minor scales, in scales exercises, have wrong key signature</b><br />
        When the option 'draw key signature' is enabled, minor scales are drawn with the major scale key signature and the necessary accidentals added to the notes. The minor scale key signature should be used instead. Now fixed.

      <b>[1601350 ] No ascending intervals in aural training</b><br />
    In exercise for aural training, intervals identification, when you select the tree types (ascending descending and harmonic) most of the generated intervals are harmonic and a few descending, but never ascending. Now fixed.

      <b>Metronome lose previous run settings. Always initialised at 20.</b><br />
      Setting the spin ctrol triggers a EVT_SPINCTRL that
      causes a metronome reset. As this worked ok in previous versions I assume it is
      due to a change in wxSpinCtrol behaviour in new wxWidgets release. Solved by
      changing metronome initialization code.
