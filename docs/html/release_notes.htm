		When the option 'draw key signature' is enabled, minor scales are drawn with the major scale key signature and the necessary accidentals added to the notes. The minor scale key signature should be used instead. Now fixed.

	  <b>Metronome lose previous run settings. Always initialized at 20.</b><br />
	  Setting the spin ctrol triggers a EVT_SPINCTRL that
	  causes a metronome reset. As this worked ok in previous versions I assume it is
	  due to a change in wxSpinCtrol behaviour in new wxWidgets release. Solved by
	  changing metronome initialization code.
