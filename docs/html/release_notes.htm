      <b>Memory leaks in scales exercise.</b><br />
      The problem was caused because old exercise score was not deleted.

    <td class="ListaPar">FIX</td>
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Interval name not displayed in ear interval exercise.</b><br />
      The problem was caused by lmInterval due to strings initialized only in one 
      constructor.
      Now, initializations have been moved to a private method and it is invoked from both
      constructors.

    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In occations, bad answers given for the exercises.</b><br />The problem was
      caused by lmPaper optimization code: if the new score pointer has the same address
      than the previous one, lmPaper did not re-draw the score and the old non-valid
      bitmaps got displayed.

    <td class="ListaPar">FIX</td>
    <td class="ListaPar">
    <b>Occasional crashes after changing interval settings in earIntervalCtrol.</b><br />
    They were caused
    because the answer buttons and their names changed but the displayed
    buttons were not re-generated to match the new exercise constrains. Links for 'play' and
    'show solution' now enabled/disabled when appropiate.
