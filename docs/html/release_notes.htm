      <b>Too much space between notes in scales exercises; sometimes the scale did not fit
      in the screen.</b><br />
      The problem has been solved.
    </td></tr>

    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Memory leaks in scales exercise.</b><br />
      The problem was caused because old exercise score was not deleted.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Interval name not displayed in ear interval exercise.</b><br />
      The problem was caused by lmInterval due to strings initialized only in one 
      constructor.
      Now, initializations have been moved to a private method and it is invoked from both
      constructors.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>In occations, bad answers given for the exercises.</b><br />The problem was
      caused by lmPaper optimization code: if the new score pointer has the same address
      than the previous one, lmPaper did not re-draw the score and the old non-valid
      bitmaps got displayed.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
      <b>Wrong answers in key signatures exercise, Spanish version.</b><br />They were
      caused by some bad translated strings .</li>
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
    <b>Scores not rendered in Windows 98.</b><br />
    The problem disappeared when changing the logical units
    to one tenth of millimeter.
    </td></tr>
<tr valign="top">
    <td class="ListaPar">
    <b>Occasional crashes after changing interval settings in earIntervalCtrol.</b><br />
    They were caused
    because the answer buttons and their names changed but the displayed
    buttons were not re-generated to match the new exercise constrains.
