<h1>LenMus Phonascus 3.5 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in 3.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A new eMusicBook included: Music Reading level 1</li>
  <li>Replaced MDI user interface by a notebook tabbed interface.</li>
  <li>The lenmus program now includes the Dutch language translation.</li>
  <li>Added support to include images on eMusicBooks texts.</li>
  <li>Score parameters in eBooks: added tag <metronome> to specify a fixed metronome
        rate to play the score, instead of using user specified value in metronome
        control.</li>
  <li>Improvements in automatic music composer:
        <ul>
          <li>Modified so that in final measure it never adds a note longer
            that a quarter note if the composed piece only uses quarter notes. This was
            needed for Music Reading Level 1 eBook, for the initial lessons.</li>
        </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in the Score internal model to support more features:
    <ul>
      <li>Support to include graphical objects (arrows, lines, circles,
        etc.) on a score. For now only lines are implemented.</li>
      <li>Implemented metronome marks notations.</li>
      <li>Added support to set up the size of a measure by specifying barline
        position.</li>
      <li>Added support for fermatas on notes and rests.</li>
      <li>Added support to have global, inheritable options in all score elements.
        Implemented support for the following options:
        <ul>
          <li>Option 'Staff.DrawLeftBarline' to control left barline drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.Hide' to control staff lines drawing.</li>
          <li>Option 'StaffLines.StopAtFinalBarline' to allow for staff lines
            going to the right paper margin instead of finishing at the final
            barline.</li>
          <li>Option 'Staff.UpperLegerLines.Displacement' to shift the first upper leger
            line so that it is closer/further than normal spacing.
            The other leger lines spacing is not changed.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Improvements in LDP language to support the new features. New tags added:
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented simple notation 'fermata', and compound notation
        '(fermata [above | below])' on notes and rests.</li>
      <li>tag 'metronome' to define metronome notations.</li>
      <li>tag 'graphic line' to add lines on a score.</li>
      <li>tag 'spacer' for better controlling staff space.</li>
      <li>tag 'opt' to add global, inheritable options to all other tags.</li>
      <li>Added support for strings enclosed in double simple quotes as
        an alternative to double quotes.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Several <a href="#bugs">bug fixes</a> and other
    technical improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="bugs">Bug fixed details</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bug fixed [#1715965]: Rests in a group of tied notes are not rendered in the right position.</li>
  <li>Bug fixed [#1715968]: Proportional spacing of notes is not functioning.</li>
  <li>Bug fixed [#1715953]: In the Midi configuration wizard the drop downs in

  <li>Bug fixed [#1715959]: Focus problem. In the configuration window when you check
        the proxy configuration but do not fill it in and then change the focus to
        section 'language', the category selector changes but the focus remains on
