<h2>What's new in 3.3</h2>

<p>Release 3.3 include new features, technical improvements and some bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A new exercise for aural training: identify scales.</li>
  <li>Theory exercise on scales identification improved: now it is user configurable and
    more scales have been included.</li>
  <li>Software updater improved: now it takes proxies into account (user request,
    task #130256).</li>
  <li>Options dialog modified to include Internet settings. Updater settings
      moved from 'Other settings' to 'Internet settings'.</li>
  <li>French and Turkish translations now included.</li>
  <li>Changing to another language is now immediate. In previous versions it
    was delayed to the next run of the program.</li>
  <li>New option to enable/disable right/wrong answer sounds in exercises (user request 
      #1559450).</li>
  <li>New option to do exercises in teams: two answer counters are displayed and each
    new problem is asigned to a different team.</li>
  <li>New option to show the solution also when the answer was right.</li>
  <li>Screen renderization code modified to deal with fractions of a pixel and

    scores.</li>
