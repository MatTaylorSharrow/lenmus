<p>Please, note two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a list of changes included in latest release, but a personal log
of things I am coding. I use it for control purposes, for example to find an answer on
mondays to question 'what was I doing last friday?', or to find when I changed something.
</li>
<li>This page is updated in the website usually only at the end of each week.</li>

        <li>Added classes lmEarChordConstrains and lmEarChordCtrolParams. More changes in
          ChordManager. Constrains.h: added lmChordConstrains. EarChord exercises now works, but

        <li>Added logic to load/save last used path to open scores. Initialized at
          '/scores/samples'.</li>
        <li>Bug fixed: occasional first system indentation on second page. Indentation
          takes place when there is no offscreen bitmap for the second page and it has to
          be generated while a note being played. x paper pos is altered by highlighted note
          and it causes and invalid position for first system. Now solved by storing
          x pos for systems instead of relying on current paper pos.</li>

          closed. Fixed by adding code to control this in LDPParser::AnalyzeNoteRest().</li>
        <li>Bug fixed: forcing stem does not work in chords. Fixed by adding m_nStemType
          variable to lmChord. Modified lmNote::SetStemDirection() to recompute
          stem length when stem direction changed.</li>

      Program frozen to proceed to launch release 3.1. Meanwhile starting with EarChord

        <li>Bug fixed: Visual highlight fails if more than one page. The problem was
          due to uncompleted code. Need to modify lmScoreObject and lmBoxSystem to keep
          page number. Modified lmBoxSystem::RenderMeasure to store page number.</li>
        <li>LDPParser: completed AnalyzeTuplet to deal with full notation. Added code to deal
          with options (optional tuplet bracket and tuplet number).</li>
        <li>Bug fixed: some literals in Zoom menu and toolbar where not prepared for
          internationalization, using _T() instead of _().</li>
        <li>Bug fixed: problem with offscreen bitmaps ordering if scale changed in 
          a page different from first one. It was caused by assuming that bitmap creation
          order was page order. Now page number associated to bitmap.</li>
        <li>Bug fixed: in occations, notes at the same time were not rendered aligned. The
          problem was caused by precision of floating numbers in comparisons.
          An error tolerance has been introduced.</li>
