Installing wxWidgets in Linux
==============================

Last updated: May/2008



This document is a quick guide to install wxWidgets for building LenMus package.

THIS GUIDE ARE JUST MY NOTES FOR DOING IT EACH TIME I HAVE TO INSTALL A NEW WXWIDGETS VERSION. This notes should be enough in most cases. Please refer to wxWidgets documentation, for more detailed instructions. 

This guide probably contains errors and inaccuracies. Please contact us if you would like to help us with creating a better and error-free document.

In this instructions it is assumed that wxWidgets is installed in /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/. Please replace as appropriate.


Steps to do:

1. Download the wxGTK source archive from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/. Place the archive in /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7  (later, you won't be able to move it without breaking the build)

2. Expand it (double click)

3. Apply the two required patches to the wxWidgtes sources. This patches are detailed in file wxWidgets_fixes.txt

4. Open a terminal window and do the following steps:

a) Move to the installation folder:

$ cd /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7


b) Create a new folder for this build. This enables us to have many wxWidgets builds (i.e. a debug and a release one). This sub directory will contain the compiled libraries to add later to your programs.

$ mkdir build-debug
$ cd build-debug


c) Call 'configure' with the needed options for the build:

Debug build:
../configure --prefix=/home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7 --disable-shared --enable-debug --enable-unicode --disable-stl --disable-std_iostreams --with-gtk --disable-compat24

Release build:
../configure --prefix=/home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7 --disable-shared --enable-unicode --disable-stl --enable-std_iostreams --with-gtk --disable-compat24

The options you pass to configure at this point will determine what build you get. For a list of all possible options, write ../configure --help

If it stops saying it can't find a package, install it (with -dev packages if any) and run configure again. 

Notes:
*	--prefix' won't accept relative paths


5. When 'configure' is done without errors, you are ready to build (using make):

$ make


6. When the build is done, and if no error occurred, you can now install it:

$ sudo make install

Enter your password when needed. wxWidgets will be installed in /usr/local/. There is a /usr/local/wx/config folder that contains the files

[Note for my eyes] Verify this: All the libraries are installed under /usr/lib and there is a /usr/lib/wx/config folder that contains the files

7. Re-directing wx-config

File /usr/local/bin/wx-config is a symbolic link to one of the files under /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-xxx/build-debug/lib/wx/config. The file that it links to is the default build and the others are the alternatives listed by wx-config --list.

So, to choose and set the default build you must set up a symbolic link in the dir where I want to call it from though. For this, after installing wxWidgets

(you did the following:
	cd /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7
	mkdir build-debug
	cd build-debug
	../configure ...blah...blah...blah
	make
)

then go to /usr/local/bin:  

$ cd /usr/local/bin

remove old link:

$ sudo rm wx-config

and define a new one:

$ sudo ln -s /home/cecilio/wxWidgets/wxGTK-2.8.7/bin/wx-config wx-config

And this is it!

The libraries will be where prefix told them to be, and wx-config will know where they are.



Test installation
-----------------------

Open a terminal and type

$ wx-config --version

It should be the version you just built.

If it is not:

    try running which wx-config and see if it is the one you just installed (if you did not change the default value, you installed /usr/local/bin/wx-config) if you get something like /usr/bin/wx-config while you installed /usr/local/bin/wx-config, it means there is another version of wxWidgets installed somewhere else, probably installed by the system. You can quickly get it out the way with a hacky command like sudo mv /usr/bin/wx-config /usr/bin/wx-config-old1. 

Then, to test more in depth, you can look at the samples. Open the Samples folder located at wxGTK-2.8.7/gtk-build/samples (be careful : wxGTK-2.8.7/samples contains the source code, while wxGTK-2.8.7/gtk-build/samples contains the makefiles for your system. for building samples, you will want to cd into the latter, while to study the code you will want to open the former)

cd into one of the samples, and type make. You can then open the sample to see wxWidgets in action.

* Test the installation using a sample:
	g++ test.c++ -o hello `wx-config` --libs --debug=no` `wx-config --cxxflags` -D NDEBUG
