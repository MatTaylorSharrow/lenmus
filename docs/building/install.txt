====================================================================================


1.1 Supported platforms
------------------------

Currently, LenMus has been tested and built in the following platforms:

- Windows XP with MS VisualStudio .NET 2003

- Linux Ubuntu, with Code::Blocks and g++

Unfortunately we don't have instructions/makefiles for any other platforms/compilers yet. Please contact us if you would like to help us with creating one for the compiler/platform you use.



1.2 Dependencies
-----------------

LenMus depends on the following software packages (installation instructions for these dependencies are given later):

- wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
    LenMus is programmed using the wxWidgets framework. Therefore, building LenMus requires to install and build wxWidgets. There is a couple of fixes to add to wxWidgets source code. One of them is critical; without it LenMus will not build. This fixes are listed in file wxwidgets_patches.txt
    
    Currently LenMus can be built with wxMSW (Windows) or wxGTK (Linux). You have to download the wxWidgets sources for the appropriate platform (http://www.wxWidgets.org/downloads/) and build it.


- FreeType (http://www.freetype.org/)
    Renderization of music symbols is done using the FreeType library. Therefore, it is required to have installed:
    
    - For Windows: freetype.dll, freetype.lib
    - For Linux: libfreetype.o
    
    Also, for both systems, the include files (.h) for the Freetype version you are installing are required. 


- Portmidi (http://?)
    LenMus require Portmidi for sound generation. Therefore, it is required to have:
    
    - For Windows: portmidi.lib, porttime.lib and portmidi.dll
    - For Linux: ibportmidi.o, libporttime.o
    

- Agg 2.4 (http://www.anti-grain.com/)
    For anti-alised renderization LenMus uses AGG 2.4. It is a collection of source files, that are already included in the LenMus source code. So you don't need to do anything to about this package.

Detailed instructions about how to install these packages are given in separate files.



====================================================================================
2. Installing under Linux
====================================================================================

These are instructions on how to build LenMus under Linux. These instructions should work for all Linux distros, as we'll be installing from sources.


Install wxWidgets (wxGTK)
-------------------------

1. Download the wxGTK source archive from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/ and expand it. If you intend to use it in place (not install it in system dirs) choose a place where it can stay forever because you won't be able to move it without breaking the build.

2. Apply the two required patches to the wxWidgtes sources. These patches are detailed in file wxwidgets_patches.txt

3. Build wxWidgets. For this please refer to wxWidgets documentation. A quick guide is included in file linux_install_wxwidgets.txt for your convenience, and it should be enough in most cases.

To compile LenMus, wxWidgets should be build with the following options:

- define symbols:
    __WXGTK__
    _UNICODE
    
  and, for debug version:
    __WXGTK__
    _UNICODE
    _DEBUG
    __WXDEBUG__
    
    
    
Install PortMidi libraries
---------------------------------

LenMus require the Portmidi libraries for sound generation. To install these libraries, the following commands should be executed on a terminal window (enter your password as needed):

sudo aptitude update                    //update the list of available packages
sudo aptitude install libportmidi       //install libportmidi
sudo aptitude install libporttime       //install libporttime
sudo updatedb                           //updates databases used by GNU locate
ls /usr/lib/libport*                    //verify that the libraries are there


    
    
Install FreeType (libraries and include files)
-------------------------------------------------------

LenMus require the FreeType package for renderization of music symbols. appart of the libraries, the include files (.h) for the FreeType version you are installing are also required to compile LenMus. To install these libraries, the following commands should be executed on a terminal window (enter your password as needed):

sudo aptitude update                    //update the list of available packages
sudo aptitude install libportmidi       //install libportmidi
sudo aptitude install libporttime       //install libporttime
sudo updatedb                           //updates databases used by GNU locate
ls /usr/lib/libfreetype                 //verify that the libraries are there

The include files have to be accesible from LenMus makefile.


Compile and build LenMus
------------------------

Once all previous pre-requisites are met, it is just a question of preparing a makefile and using your favourite compiler to compile and build LenMus. Makefiles are included for:

- Linux Ubuntu, with Code::Blocks and g++

Unfortunately we don't have instructions/makefiles for any other platforms/compilers yet. Please contact us if you would like to help us with creating one for the compiler/platform you use.


a) Using Code::Blocks with g++

The appropriate project file for Code::Blocks is in folder .../lenmus/build/gtk/lenmus.cbp.
Open this file with Code::Blocks and build LenMus. 

That's all.



Problems with MIDI sound
----------------------------

When installing LenMus in Linux you might find problems with sound as a MIDI synthesizer is not installed by default in some Linux distros. In file 'linux_install_midi.txt' you will find some instructions to install a Midi software synthesis package.




====================================================================================
3. Installing under Windows
====================================================================================

Install wxWidgets (wxMSW)
-------------------------

1. Download the wxMSW source zip archive from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/ and expand it.

2. Apply the two required patches to the wxWidgtes sources. These patches are detailed in file wxwidgets_patches.txt

3. Build wxWidgets. For this please refer to wxWidgets documentation. A quick guide is included in file windows_install_wxwidgets.txt for your convenience, and it should be enough in most cases.


    
Install PortMidi libraries
---------------------------------

LenMus require the Portmidi libraries for sound generation. The libraries are already included in the LenMus source code package, so you have nothing to do.

Nevertheless, if you prefer to use a later version or to build this library by yourself, you will have to download the portmidi package and follow the instructions in this package.

    
Install FreeType (libraries and include files)
-------------------------------------------------------

LenMus require the FreeType package for renderization of music symbols. appart of the libraries, the include files (.h) for the FreeType version you are installing are also required to compile LenMus. All of them are already included in the LenMus source code package, so you have nothing to do.

Nevertheless, if you prefer to use a later version or to build this library by yourself, you will have to download the FreeType package and follow the instructions in this package to build the library. Once built, copy the following folders and replace those in lenmus/packages/freetype:
    - freetype/include
    - freetype/bin
    - freetype/lib

    


Compile and build LenMus
------------------------

Once wxWidgets is installed, it is just a question of preparing a makefile and using your favourite compiler to compile and build LenMus. Makefiles and project files are included only for:

- MS VisualStudio

Unfortunately we don't have instructions/makefiles for any other platforms/compilers yet. Please contact us if you would like to help us with creating one for the compiler/platform you use.


a) Using MS VisualStudio

The appropriate project file for MS VisualStudio is in folder .../lenmus/build/msw/lenmus.sln.
Open this file with MS VisualStudio and build LenMus. 

That's all.
