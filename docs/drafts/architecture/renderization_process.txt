Renderization process
--------------------------


Two behaviours:

- ScoreView: Score size is fixed and determined by paper size. Re-layout is only
    needed when requested by the user.
    
- ScoreAuxCtrol: A ctrol for display. Size varies if the user resizes the parent
    window and, then, re-layout is needed. Limited to one page.
    
    
    
    
Methods:

Layout -> the graphical model is built. All measurements in logical units (tenths).
    No problem with bitmaps sizes as no bitmpas are involved.
    
Render -> the graphical model is interpreted and a bitmap for the requested page
    is created. Logical units translated to device units.
