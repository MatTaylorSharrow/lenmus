To maintain the linux building files you need to maintain 3 main files:

- configure.ac
	This files contains references to:
		- Libraries (currently these references include the full path, in the future we should change them to be more "automatic")
- Makefile.am
	This file contains a reference to src/Makefile and should contain other files or directories to add when deploying the App (make install)
- src/Makefile.am
	This file contains:
		-the list of include directories
		-the list of source files
		-executable name and final location
