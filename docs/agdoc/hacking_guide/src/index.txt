\title    {LenMus Hacking Guide}
\subtitle {Rationale and internals of the LenMus program}



**Purpose and organization**

The purpose of this document is mainly to describe and document the internals of the LenMus program. This will be done in a way oriented to help any one interested in learning the internals of the program in order to hack it and to design new features.

Each theme is going to be divided, when applicable, into two main sections: Program description and Miscellaneous notes.

 * \b{Program description} section is always presented first. It describes lenmus program implementation.

 * \b{Miscellaneous notes} will always contain different pieces of information, presented in an unstructured way, that could help you to understand the program, such as theory background information or the notes I wrote to help me to rationalize my ideas when having to design that feature or to solve a problem.
 
The Hacking Guide will be an open document, that is, more content will be added and its structure will be changed from time to time, until the necessary level of detail and quality is achieved.

Any help to structure, review, improve, etc. this document is welcome!.
