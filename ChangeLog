LenMus Phonascus 4.1
=======================================================================



LenMus Phonascus 4.0 (January 17th, 2009)
=======================================================================

As the version number change suggests, release 4.0 is major update in
the program code and functionality. The main changes are:

Inclusion of a score editor (beta status)

The major change from previous release 3.6 is the inclusion of a score
editor (althoug in beta status). The score editor is not yet finished, 
as much more features have to be added, but the included features are 
operational, and allows to create simple scores, even with several 
instruments and voices. Nevertheless, the editor is in a preliminary state
(beta status) and it is mainly useful deal with simple scores with one 
voice per staff. Many voices per staff are also supported but facilities 
to automate layouting task and taking automated decisions, such as 
automatic voice assignment, automatically setting up stem direction in 
notes to avoid collisions between stems, and other facilities, are not 
fully operational and in some cases produce poor results. Also, at 
current development stage, it is not possible to deal with:

    * lyric lines
    * slurs
    * dynamics, articulations and other symbols
    * cue/grace notes
    * rehearsal marks, coda, segno and related symbols
    * nested tuples
    * figures: lines, boxes, circles, other

These missing features will be added in coming releases. The basements 
are now there, so I expect to add much more features in short time.

One of the issues that has demanding me a lot of time is the user interface.
I would like to find a simple and intuitive interface, but the complexities
involved in editing a score makes this difficult to achieve. Therefore, do
not assume the user interface is finished as I will continue experimenting
with different approaches. Your suggestions are extremelly welcome,
specially if you have experience in using other score editors.

Change of license to GPL v3+

The extensive code re-writing required to include the score editor and the
fact that including a score editor is a major change in program features are
the main reasons to change release number to 4.0 instead of 3.7.

With release 4.0 I also have changed the program license to the new Free
Software Foundation GPL V3+. With this change, I expect to better ensure
your rights to use LenMus for free, to have access to source code, and to be
able to distribute it to others and to modify it. The change to GPL v3+ is
also a reason to change the release number to 4.0. With this change it will
be more identifiable which license applies to which lenmus version:

    * lenmus 1.x - freeware. Source code not available
    * lenmus 2.x & 3.x - GPL v2+
    * lenmus 4.x - GPL v3+

Welcome page

A welcome page has been added to facilitate access to the different features
and to have easily available on startup:

    * eBooks
    * The score editor
    * Latest open scores
    * Useful links and documentation

Other changes

Version 4.0 does not include new music eBooks or exercises. But bugs
detected in previous versions have been fixed.

Three new translations has been added: Basque, Galician and Italian.

 
 

LenMus Phonascus 3.6 (December 1st, 2007)
=======================================================================

Some new features and changes are introduced:

    * A new eBook with theory and exercises on cadences.
    * The automatic composer algorithm has been rewritten to take into
      account harmony rules. Scores in music reading exercises are now 
      'singable' and takes tonality into account.
    * Some errors corrected in Music Reading Level 1 eBook
    * French translation has been totally reviewed.
    * Some bug fixes and other technical improvements:
          o Bug fixed [#1742061]: Occasional crash on Ear Interval exercise.
          o Bug fixed [#1742062]: Intervals: theory exercise. No button 
            for 2dim answer.
          o Bug fixed [#1823932]: Score symbols bad positioned when no
            standard screen resolution.
          o Bug fixed [#1742064]: Scales identification: ambiguity in 
            answer buttons.

LenMus Phonascus 3.5 (June 17th, 2007)
=======================================================================

Some new features are introduced that affect the users' experience of 
the software:

    * A new eMusicBook is included: Music Reading level 1
    * Playback: a rhythmic accent was added. Higher volume on stronger 
      beats.
    * The MDI user interface was replaced by a notebook tabbed interface.
    * The lenmus program now includes the Dutch language translation.

Additionally, the new version has a lot of technical changes and some 
bug fixes:

    * Support was added to include images in eMusicBook texts.
    * Score parameters in eBooks: added tag to specify a fixed metronome
      rate to play the score instead of using a user specified value in the
      metronome control.
    * Improvements in the automatic music composer:
          o The composer was modified so that in the final measure it never
            adds a note longer that a quarter note if the composed piece
            only uses quarter notes. This was needed for Music Reading Level
            1 eBook, for the initial lessons.
    * Improvements in the internal score model to support more features:
          o Support to include graphical objects (arrows, lines, circles,
            etc.) in a score. For now only lines are implemented.
          o Implemented metronome mark notations.
          o Added support to set up the size of a measure by specifying 
            the barline position.
          o Added support for fermatas on notes and rests.
          o Added support to have global, inheritable options in all 
            score elements. Implemented support for the following options:
                + Option 'Staff.DrawLeftBarline' to control left barline 
                  drawing.
                + Option 'StaffLines.Hide' to control staff lines drawing.
                + Option 'StaffLines.StopAtFinalBarline' to allow for staff
                  lines going to the right paper margin instead of finishing
                  at the final barline.
                + Option 'Staff.UpperLegerLines.Displacement' to shift the
                  first upper leger line so that it is closer/further than
                  normal spacing. The other leger lines spacing is not
                  changed.
                + Options 'Render.SpacingMethod' and 'Render.SpacingValue',
                  to allow for more control of score renderization.
    * Improvements in score renderization:
          o Fixed spacing method implemented.
          o Fixed bug [#1715968]. Proportional spacing of notes is 
            now working.
          o Do not add spacing after barline if barline is not visible.
    * Improvements in LDP language to support the new features. New 
      tags added:
          o Implemented simple notation 'fermata', and compound notation
            '(fermata [above | below])' on notes and rests.
          o tag 'metronome' to define metronome notations.
          o tag 'graphic line' to add lines on a score.
          o tag 'spacer' for better controlling staff space.
          o tag 'opt' to add global, inheritable options to all other tags.
          o Added support for strings enclosed in double simple quotes as 
            an alternative to double quotes.
    * Several bug fixes:
          o Bug fixed [#1724988]: Crash if program is closed while playing
            intervals in aural training compare intervals exercise.
          o Bug fixed [#1715979]: When you have a score open, the 'show/hide
            navigation panel' button shows as active but you cannot click
            on it.
          o Bug fixed [#1715953]: In the Midi configuration wizard the 
            drop downs in the wizard should not be editable.
          o Bug fixed [#1715959]: Focus problem. In the configuration 
            window when you check the proxy configuration but do not fill it
            in and then change the focus to section 'language', the category
            selector changes but the focus remains on the Internet section.
            Alternatively you could generate a warning message and leave the
            focus on the Internet section.
          o Bug fixed [#1715963]: Repeated quick acceleration letters in
            options, menu labels. The English text has the same letter as
            quick key for bottom and right labels.
          o Bug fixed [#1715965]: Rests in a group of tied notes are not 
            rendered in the right position.
          o Bug fixed [#1715968]: Proportional spacing of notes is 
            not working.
          o Bug fixed [#176634]: Program crash if closed while playing 
            a score.
          o Bug fixed [#176635]: Crash if program is closed while playing
            an exercise (L2_MusicReading).
          o Bug fixed [#1590088]: Program crash if move to another 
            exercise while playing an exercise.
