You can set various options that affect LenMus globally. There are three setting groups.
</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Language</h3>
    <blockquote>
    Allows you to choose the language to use for eBooks and user interface. The
    choosen language will be applied the next time the LenMus program is run.
    <b>Important: Only eBooks whose language is the same than the
    user interface language will be shown</b>. This implies than the real content
    of the LenMus program could vary, depending of the choosen language.
    </blockquote>

<h3>Toolbars</h3>
    <blockquote>
    You can choose different options for the toolbars, such as using only icons
    without any text, displaying the icon text in different positions, or change
    the size of the toolbar icons.
    </blockquote>

<h3>Other</h3>
    <blockquote>
    Other options not included in previous setting groups. Currently the
    only setting in this group is the option to automatically check for
    program updates, by connecting to internet at program start.
    </blockquote>
