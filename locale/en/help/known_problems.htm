        This is a technical problem to be solved in a future version. It is caused by
        the usage a pre-packaged module (wxHtmlHelpController) to accelerate the release
        of version 3.0. I have plans to re-write the functionality provided
        by this module and, then, unify both print buttons.

        This is a technical problem reported to wxWidgets maintainers. If you are
        curious about the nature of the problem, its cause was traced back to
        wxHtmlHelpController. wxHtmlWidgetCell is not prepared for printing and ignores
        the DC, rendering always on the parent window. Then lesson content is printed
        correctly but not LenMus embedded objects (i.e., scores) that are ignored.
