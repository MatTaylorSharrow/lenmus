<h1>LenMus Phonascus 4.1 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in 4.1</h2>

<p>The main changes introduced by release 4.1 are the following:<p>



The interval's exercise has been reviewed and splitted into two exercises, one to identify intervals and aonother one to build them. The identification exercise has been structured into four difficulty levels.

The exercise settings has been rebuild and there are now more options.


// Leitner learning method. The idea is to generate questions not at random but giving priority
// according to individual user needs. The method gradually adapt questions priorities to user
// needs based on success/failures to previous questions, to generate an optimal sequence
// of question repetitions, tailored to user profile.

<p><b>Score editor</b></p>

The score editor now supports an 'exercises mode'. Working in this mode, the
editor is restricted to use only the options required by the exercise. For example, for four-parts harmony exercises for beginners level, the editor is restricted to use only quarter notes, four voices, etc. Also the toolbox will include special buttons for the exercise.


<p><b>Harmony exercises</b></p>

Two new exercises included:
The four-parts harmony exercise is oriented to learn and practice (write, listen to) four-parts harmony. Its main purpose is checking and explaining every possible error.

Two exercise types: given bass (or given soprano).

The score can be saved so that later you can continue the exercise.


<p><b>Theory on intervals, chords and scales</b></p>

More chapters has been added to the eBook 'Theory and harmony', to explain theory about intervals, chords and scales.


<p><b>Bug fixes</b></p>

<p>Version 4.1 does not include new music eBooks or exercises. But bugs
detected in previous versions have been fixed.</p>
