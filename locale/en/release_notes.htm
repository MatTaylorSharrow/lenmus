<h1>LenMus Phonascus 4.0 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>What's new in 4.0</h2>

<p>After one year of work LenMus 4.0 beta 1 is
available. This is the last release before stable version that should be released
in few weeks.</p>

<p>As the version number change suggests, release 4.0 is major
update in the program code and functionality. The main changes are:<p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#editor">Inclusion of a score editor</a></li>
    <li><a href="#license">Change of license to GPL v3+</a></li>
    <li><a href="#bugs">Bug fixes</a></li>
</ul>

<p> A welcome page has been added to facilitate access to the different features and to
have easily available on startup:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eBooks</li>
  <li>The score editor</li>
  <li>Latest open scores</li>
  <li>Useful links and documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes are explained in the following sections.</p>


<h3><a name="editor">Score creation and edition</a></h3>

<p>The major change from previous release 3.6 is the inclusion of a score editor. It is not yet finished, as much more features have to be added, but the included features are fully operational, and allows to create simple scores, even with several instruments and voices. Nevertheless, the editor is at a preliminary state and currently it is not possible to deal with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>lyric lines</li>
  <li>slurs</li>
  <li>dynamics, articulations and other symbols</li>
  <li>cue/grace notes</li>
  <li>rehearsal marks, coda, segno and related symbols</li>
  <li>nested tuples</li>
  <li>figures: lines, boxes, circles, other</li>
</ul>

<p>These missing features will be added in coming releases. The basements are now there, so I expect to add much more features in short time.</p>

<p>
One of the issues that has demanding me a lot of time is the user interface. I would like to find a simple and intuitive interface, but the complexities involved in editing a score makes this difficult to achieve. Therefore, do not assume the user interface is finished. I'm quite sure I will change things in coming releases.
</p>



<h3><a name="license">Change of license to GPL v3+</a></h3>

<p>The extensive code re-writing required to include the score editor and the fact that including a score editor is a major change in program features are the main reasons to change release number to 4.0 instead of 3.7.</p>

<p>With release 4.0 I also have changed the program license to the new Free Software Foundation GPL V3+. With this change, I expect to better ensuring your rights to use LenMus for free, to have access to source code, and to be able to distribute it to others and to modify it. The change to GPL v3+ is also a reason to change the release number to 4.0. With this change it will be more identifiable which license applies to which lenmus version:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lenmus 1.x - freeware. Source code not available</li>
    <li>lenmus 2.x & 3.x - GPL v2+</li>
    <li>lenmus 4.x - GPL v3+</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="bugs">Music eBooks, exercises and bugs</a></h3>

<p>Version 4.0 does not include new music eBooks or exercises. But bugs detected in previous versions have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All code related to text and scores size, screen resolution, and zooming in eBooks has been reviewed in depth. As a result some bugs were discovered and fixed. I expect to have all problems related to this issues definitively fixed.</li>
</ul>
