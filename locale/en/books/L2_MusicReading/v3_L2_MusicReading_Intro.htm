<h1>Music reading. Level 2. Introduction</h1>

<p>In level2 we continue with all concepts introduced in Level 1, and new concepts
are introduced in a progressive way, alternating simple time signatures and duple time ones.</p>


<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>Appart of introducing new rhythmic cells, of increasing complexity, the main concepts
introduced in Level 2 are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple time signatures of 2/8 and 3/8.</li>
<li>Triplets, and triplet note groups with rests.</li>
<li>Extension of the stave in treble (G) and bass (F) clefs to include two ledger
lines below and above each stave.</li>
<li>Compound time signatures of 9/8, 12/8 and the grouping of notes and rests
within these times.</li>
<li>The soprano clef (C on 1st line). Names of notes on the stave.</li>
<li>Extension of the stave in C1 clef to include one ledger line above the stave.</li>
<li>Key signatures of all major and minor keys up to and including four sharps and flats.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Lesson's structure</h2>
<p>Each lesson is structured into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the first one the new concepts and rhythmic patterns introduced in the lesson
are explained.</li>

<li>In the second section, optional, the new concepts are compared with known ones, so
that the student can better relate the new material and learn it.</li>

<li>Finally, in the third section some exercises are proposed to learn and practise
the new concepts introduced.</li>

</ul>
