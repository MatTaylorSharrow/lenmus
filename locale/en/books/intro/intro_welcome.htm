<h1>Welcome to LenMus Phonascus version 3.1</h1>
<p>Phonascus, from Latin 'the teacher of music', is a music education software that you can
use to practice your music reading skills, improve your ear training abilities, or just learn the
fundamental principles of music theory and language.
From version 3.1 it includes new functions that, I hope,
will end up with full support for the creation, display,
printing, play back and interactive edition of music scores. This version 3.1 just allows
you to load, display, print and play back scores prepared as text files. Visit the
LenMus web site for more information.</p>


<p>
LenMus Phonascus allows you to focus on specific skills and exercises, on
both theory and ear training. The different activities can be customized to meet
your specific needs at each moment and it allows you to work at your own pace.</p>

<p>LenMus is structured as a collection of fully interactive textbooks (eBooks), including
    theory and exercises.
    All exercises are fully
    integrated into the text. Music scores are not just
    images or pictures but fully interactive operational music scores that you can hear,
    in whole or just the measures you choose. This enables you
    to put concepts into practice with immediate feedback and makes the subject matter both
    more accessible and more rewarding, as you can hear, test and put in practise
    immediately any new concept introduced.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building and spelling intervals, scales and tonal keys.</li>
  <li>Ear training: identification of intervals and scales.</li>
  <li>Rhythm and music reading exercises.</li>
</ul>


<p >Teaching material is organized into levels, and each level into lessons. In this
version the following books are is included:</p>

    your specific needs at each moment and to practise specific points.</li>
