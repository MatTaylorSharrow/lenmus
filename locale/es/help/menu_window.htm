<h1>Window Menu</h1>

<h2>How to get there</h2>
The Window menu is an item of main window menu:
<br /><br /><img src="img/main_menu.png">


<h2>What it does</h2>
The Window menu controls and shows which windows are open, and which are in front
(active). It also has Tile and Cascade commands, which automatically and neatly
arrange multiple open windows into a more convenient layout.

<h2>Commands</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="2">
<tr bgcolor="#ddddff">
    <td><b>Button</b></td>
    <td><b>Command&nbsp;name</b></td>
    <td><b>Shortcut</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#f0f0ff">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Cascade</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>If more than one document window is open on the screen, this command neatly
        stacks them so that they overlap by a half-inch or so, as though they’re a
        deck of cards being
        fanned from upper-left to lower-right. Because this arrangement
        leaves each window’s title
        bar visible, it’s easy to jump from one window to another (by clicking
        any visible part of it).
        The active window is the one in the lower-right.</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#f0f0ff">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Tile Vertically<br />Tile Horizontally</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>If more than one document window is open on the screen,
        this command neatly places them side-by-side (tile vertically) or one
        atop the other (tile horizontally), subdividing your screen area so
        that all windows are the same size. The active window
        is the one in the upper left corner.</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#f0f0ff">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Arrange Icons</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Choose Arrange Icons to line up any file icons that appear within the application
        window. When you choose this command, LenMus neatly arranges the icons
        for the minimized files at the bottom of the application window.</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#f0f0ff">
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Next</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>If more than one document window is open on the screen,
        this command jumps to the next window and sets it as the active one, making
        it fully visible.</td></tr>
