<h1>LenMus Phonascus Basics</h1>

<p>Phonascus, from latin 'the teacher of music', is a music education software that you can
use to practice your music reading skills, improve your ear training abilities, or just learn the
fundamental principles of music theory and language.</p>

<h2>Modes of operation</h2>

    <p>LenMus Phonascus has two modes of operation:</p>
    <ol>
    <li> As a reader of interactive music books (eBooks); and</li>
    <li> As a tool to create and edit music scores and to play them back.
        This second functionality (score editor / play back) is now under development and
        is disabled in current version.</li>
    </ol>


<h2>Reading eBooks: interactive books on music</h2>

    <p>Phonascus is designed as a fully interactive textbook. All exercises are fully
    integrated into the text. Music scores are not just
    images or pictures but fully interactive operational music scores that you can hear,
    in whole or just the measures you select. This enables you
    to put concepts into practice with immediate feeback and makes the subject matter both
    more accessible and more rewarding to you, as you can hear, test and put in practise
    inmediately any new concept introduced.</p>
