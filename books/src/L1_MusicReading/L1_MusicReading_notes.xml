<para>
We have learn that the vertical position of a note on the staff determines its pitch.
The duration of the note (that, is the duration of its sound) is indicated by using
different types of signs for the notes, so each note sign corresponds to a different
duration. The following picture shows the different types of notes and their names:

In the coming lessons we will start using only the quarter note and will learn about notes
duration, and progressively we will
introduce the other note symbols. In this lesson we are going to learn some basic terminology
about note symbols
and some rules about how to draw them.
</para>

<para>
The note symbols have three distinct parts: (1) the note-head, (2) the stem and
(3) the flag (also named hook or tail), as depicted in next figure:

<para>
Stems normally go up for notes placed below the third line and 
go down for notes placed on or above the third line:

<para>
Stems are drawn on the right-hand side of the note-head when the stem goes up, and on
the left-hand side of the note-head when the stem goes down. Flags are always drawn
on the right-hand side of the stem:

<para>
Often, consecutive notes with flags are linked together in groups by replacing the flags
by lines called 'beams'. The number of beams must be the same that the number of flags
each individual note would have had when drawn isolated. In the following example
the four individual notes at the first part can also be drawn grouped, 
as shown in the second part:
