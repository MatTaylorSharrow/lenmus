<title>The figures: notes and rests</title>

<para>
We have learn that the vertical position of a note on the staff determines its pitch.
The duration of the note (that, is the duration of its sound) is indicated by using
different types of signs for the notes, so its note sign corresponds to a different
duration. The following picture shows the different types of notes and their names:

<para>
The note signs have three distinct parts: (1) the note-head, (2) the stem and
(3) the flag (also named hook or tail), as depicted in next figure:

The stem  can rise from the note-head, in which case it lies on the right-hand 
side of the note-head, or fall from the note-head, in which case it lies on the 
left hand side of the note-head  (see the two crotchets (quarter notes)).

In either case, the flag lies on the right-hand side of the stem (see the 
two quavers (eighth notes)). 

Beams and Beaming  
When notes  with flags  lie together in groups they are often linked by one or more 
lines called beams. The number of beams reflect the number of flags  each would 
have had when an individual note.
