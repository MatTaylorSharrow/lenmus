<para>
To determine which pitch is represented by each line and space in the staff a symbol, named
'the clef' is placed at the beginning of each staff. In this course we are going to start
with the study of the G clef, also named 'treble clef', that is represented by the
following symbol:
</para>

<!-- Empty staff with a G clef -->
<score width="600" height="100" border="0">
    <score_type>short</score_type>
    <music_border>0</music_border>
    <music>
        (Metrica 2 4 noVisible)(Barra Doble noVisible))
    </music>
</score>


<para> The clef assigns a particular line 
to a specific pitch, and all other pitches are mapped in ascending and descending order to
the lines and spaces above and below that reference line. In the G clef, the G note of 
the four octave is assigned
to the second line and, as a result, the staff lines and spaces get automatically assigned
to the following notes:
