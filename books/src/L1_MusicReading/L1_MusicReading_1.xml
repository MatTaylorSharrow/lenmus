<title>The staff</title>

<para>In the Western musical notation system music is written on specially printed 
paper called 'manuscript paper' (see picture).
</para>

<!-- image: manuscript paper -->

<para>The manuscript paper is organized as sets of horizontal lines, named 'staves'
(each group of horizontal
lines is called a 'staff', with 'staves' as the plural; in British English the word 'staff' is old-fashioned and 
rarely used; they use the word 'stave' instead). A staff is a set of five horizontal lines, 
numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the first line and the top line 
is the fifth line:

<para>
The musical symbols are placed on the staff. The symbols for notes are placed either on a 
line or on a space and the musical pitch (low or high) represented by the symbol 
is determined by the position 
of the note on the staff. Notes on the higher lines/spaces have higer pitch than 
those on the lower ones. Lesson to the next scale:
