<para>You know that in written music sound is indicated by using note symbols, and 
that there exits a note symbol for each duration. In written music silence is also
indicated with symbols, called 'rests'. There also exists a rest for each note duration.
The following score shows a quarter note and the quarter rest:

In this lesson we will start music reading by exercising to read scores composed
just by quarter notes and rests. These rhythms are very simple as each note or rest
gets a beat. Lesson, for example, the first four measures of the
popular song Frere Jacques:

        (Metrica 2 4)(n g4 n)(n a4 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n b4 n)(n g4 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n g4 n)(n a4 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n b4 n)(n g4 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n b4 n)(n c5 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n d5 n)(s n)(Barra Simple)
        (n b4 n)(n c5 n)(Barra Simple)
        (n d5 n)(s n)(Barra Final))

Now is your time to start reading music. Remember to mark the beats with your
hand or foot. Use also the metronome. The notes range will be very reduced (two first lines
and first space, notes E4, F4 and G4) to
help you to memorize them. The range will be broaden, progressively and slowly, in
following lessons.
