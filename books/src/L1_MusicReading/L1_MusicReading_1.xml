<title>The staff</title>

<para>
In the Western musical notation system music is written on specially printed 
paper called "manuscript paper". [1. imagen de papel pautado] Each group of horizontal
lines is called a "staff", with "staves" as the plural. Note that althoug in American 
English "staff" is the right term, in British English the word "staff" is old-fashioned and 
rarely used; they use the word "stave" instead. 
</para>

<para>The staff is a set of five horizontal lines, 
numbered from bottom to top; the bottom line is the first line and the top line 
is the fifth line:

<para>
The musical symbols are placed on the staff. Note symbols are placed either on a 
line or on a space and musical pitch (low or high) is determined by the position 
of the note on the staff. Notes on the higher lines/spaces have higer pitch than 
those on the lower ones. Lesson to the next scale:
