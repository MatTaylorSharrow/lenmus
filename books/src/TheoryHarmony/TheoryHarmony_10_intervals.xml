<title>Why should you learn about 'intervals'?</title>

<para>
A great step in studying something is understanding its purpose.
</para>

<para>
If you are interested in harmony and composition, you should know that intervals are the building blocks of harmony: you will not be able to understand harmony without studying about intervals.
</para>

<para>
But even if you are not interested on harmony and on theory about music, understanding intervals and being able to quickly and accurately recognize them is vital for reading and singing a score accurately. Also, it is essential for music dictation (writing the music you hear).
</para>

<para>
Therefore, we encourage you to study intervals and do all proposed exercises until you master recognition of intervals, both aurally and on written music.

<title>What is an interval?</title>

<para>
An interval is the distance between two pitches. Intervals are named by the number of steps between the two tones. So, to determine the interval between two notes we just count the number of notes, including both.  For example, the interval C-E is three notes (C, D & E). Therefore, the interval C-E is named a 'third'. Another example, interval E-B is a 'fifth', because there are five notes between E-B (E, F, G, A & B).

The following score shows some examples of intervals within one octave:

At first you may need to count the notes to determine the interval size but with practise you will learn to determine the intervals at first sight.
