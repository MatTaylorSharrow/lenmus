<para>It takes a lot of time to prepare an eBbook. So we have decided to publish the 
chapters, themes and articles as soon as we write them, instead of waiting until the book is finalized. All these provisional themes and articles are bundled into this eBook. 
Therefore the 'Theory and harmony' eBook is currently just a collection of un-ordered/un-related themes.</para>
