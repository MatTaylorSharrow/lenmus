<title>Cadences</title>

<para>
In music, the term 'cadence' has several meanings. In harmony we are going to refer to a particular sequence of usually two chords whose function is to create a sensation of either  stability, rest and ending, or of pause, tension and unstablility. Cadences have a function similar to that of the punctuation marks (comma, period, etc.) in written language: they mark breathing places and pauses in the music, they serve to structure the musical phrases, and they also helps to establish tonality. For example listen to the following three chords:

You will notice the feeling of conclusion, of reaching the end of a musical piece. The chord sequence does not create expectations of continuation. The composer could end the musical composition in the last played chord and the listener will perceive that the end has been reached and remain 'satisfied' with finishing at that point. On the contrary, listen to the following sequence of chords:

Now the sensation is not conclusive. It is more like a short pause and it creates expectations for continuation. If we finish the music in the last sounded chord we will leave the listener waiting for more.

Cadences are not difficult to recognize by ear but it is sometimes harder to recognize them in written music.

<title>Cadence types</title>
Depending on the sensation they create cadences are classified in two fundamental types:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Terminal cadences</emphasis>. They create a sensation of stability, rest and ending of the musical phrase or sentence. 
</listitem>
<listitem>
<emphasis>Transient cadences</emphasis>. They are characterized for creating tension and sensation of unstablility, as well as creating expectations of continuation.
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
As a training exercise you will hear a cadence and based on the sensation it creates on you, try to identify if it is a terminal cadence is or transient one.
