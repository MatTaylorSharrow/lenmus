   The lenmuslib library for C++ is a open source library that provides
   support for dealing with music scores: renderization, edition and 
   play back. It is platform independent. 
   
    * Platform independent (Windows, Linux, ..)
    * Use modern advanced C++: templates, design patterns, integrated tests.
    * No GUI:
        - output will be bitmaps / SVG stream / file streams
        - input will be file streams, text commands
    * Internal music language is LDP. Support for importing/exporting 
    MusicXML is also included in the library.
    * The library has a companion testing program for automatically checking 
    all its functionality (Test Driven Development used for all the 
    library, except for code re-used from current lenmus program. But even
    in these cases, some integration tests are included).
    * a wrapper so that the library can be used from wxWidgets is also included.
